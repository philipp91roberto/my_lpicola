'read_data_with_potential.py'
A python script to read the snapshot output of L-PICOLA 
with POTENTIAL enabled. It stores the postion, velocity 
and potential in arrays with shapes (N,3), (N,3), (N,1) 
respectively, where N is the number of particles in the 
snapshot slice.

'read_potentia√lgrid.py'
A python script to read the snapshot output of √L-PICOLA 
with POTENTIAL and GONGRID enabled. It stores the potential 
on a mesh as an array with shape (N,4), where N is the 
number of particles in the slice√. The first 3 elements 
of the last axis are the particle's coordinates and the 4th
is the potentia√l value on that position.
