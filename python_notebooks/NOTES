This folder contains:

'data/'
A folder, in which data from GADGET-2 and L-PICOLA simulation 
of a 100 Mpc box with 128^3 particles are stored.

'healpy_maps/'
A folder, in which HEALPix maps of the potential and density 
of the data in 'data/' are stored.

'plots/'
A folder, in which various python plots of the data in 'data/' 
are stored.

'sim_slice_images/'
A folder with python images of the snapshot outputs (slices).

'data2array.py'
A python script, which reads the data of every simulation output 
(slices) and stores them into one numpy array from GAFGET-2 and 
L-PICOLA.

'fft-spolver.py'
A python script, which contains routines to solve the poisson eq. 
of the peculiar gravitational potential from the particles position 
and an Cloud-in-Cell algorithm.

'healpy_plotter.py'
A python script, which contains functions to plot the potential and 
density from the data in 'data/' as HEALPix maps.

'lpicola_vs_gadget_partpot.ipynb'
A python notebook, which contains routines, function calls to read, 
write data, make plots and maps, evaluate data, etc.
