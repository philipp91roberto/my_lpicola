#What is QdD1da() function at line 151 in cosmo.c supposed to do? 

#Should a member of gadget header be created, which holds "GPot"? 

#Is the variable "fac" in lightcone.c relevant for calculating the potential at specific redshift?

#Must the potential be interpolated like the position or velocity in the lightcone sim?
 If that's the case, then the way the potential is stored in function "Drift_Lightcone" of lightcone.c must be alterned.
 We probably have to reconsider the memory allocation for storing the information about each particle.
 The definiton of the pointer "block" in lightcone.c holds the allocated memory.

#Is any information about the gravitational potentail notable in the *.info file?

#I'm not sure about the assignement of the FFT'ed potential "dens"
 in the function "Forces" of the code auxPM.c.

#The forces "N1*" are treated in the parallelisation process
 at the end of function "Forces". I think GPot needs one as well.

#What are the main differencies between gaussianity, non-gaussianity, generic non-gaussianity
 with respect to the gravitational potential?

#What is actually the variable "cp1p2p3tre" meant to be for?
 It seems like it isn't used in the non-local part any more.
